## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based implementation of the classic card game, Blackjack. It features a console-based user interface where players can play against a virtual dealer, place bets, and experience the core mechanics of Blackjack, including hitting, staying, and managing a virtual bankroll.

## Features
- **Player vs Dealer Gameplay**: Compete against a computer-controlled dealer.
- **Betting System**: Start with an initial bankroll and place bets each round.
- **Automatic Dealer Logic**: The dealer automatically plays according to standard Blackjack rules.
- **Win/Loss Calculation**: Determine the outcome of each round based on Blackjack rules.
- **Replayability**: Option to play multiple rounds with accumulating funds.

## How to Run the Game
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
- **Download**: Clone the repository or download the source code.
- **Compile**: Navigate to the src directory and compile the Java files.
- **Run**: Start the game by running the Main class.

## How to Play
1. At the start, enter the number of players and their names.
2. Each player is prompted to place a bet at the beginning of a round.
3. Players then choose to 'hit' or 'stay' during their turn.
4. The dealer plays automatically after all players have finished their turns.
5. Wins, losses, and ties are calculated automatically, and winnings are added to your bankroll.
6. At the end of each round, players can choose to play another round or exit the game.
